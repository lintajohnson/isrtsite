"It was incredible, it looked as if it came from a film set. There were people running and there was a big explosion in the background," he says. He asked Goodman where it came from and was told "That's my day job, I am a soldier."

Wilson spent hours looking through the images on Goodman's laptop and struck up a friendship with him. When Goodman's commander, Brig Andrew Mackay, was looking for a way to record his unit's next deployment to Afghanistan, he commissioned Wilson to come and take photographs. The result was a best-selling book.
